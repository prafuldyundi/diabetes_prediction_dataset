# diabetes_prediction_dataset
#### Overview :
This repository contains a MySQL database and analysis scripts for conducting a diabetic patient analysis. The dataset includes information such as EmployeeName, Patient_id, gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and diabetes.

#### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis on a dataset containing information about diabetic patients. The dataset is stored in a MySQL database and includes columns such as EmployeeName, Patient_id, gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and diabetes.

#### Questions to Address
#### 1. Retrieve the Patient_id and ages of all patients.
#### 2. Select all female patients who are older than 40.
#### 3. Calculate the average BMI of patients.
#### 4. List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.
#### 5. Find patients who have hypertension and diabetes.
#### 6. Determine the number of patients with heart disease.
#### 7. Group patients by smoking history and count how many smokers and nonsmokers there are.
#### 8. Retrieve the Patient_ids of patients who have a BMI greater than the average BMI.
#### 9. Find the patient with the highest HbA1c level and the patient with the lowest HbA1c level.
#### 10. Calculate the age of patients in years (assuming the current date as of now).
#### 11. Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group.
#### 12. Update the smoking history of patients who are older than 50 to "Ex-smoker."
#### 13. Insert a new patient into the database with sample data.
#### 14. Delete all patients with heart disease from the database.
#### 15. Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator.
#### 16. Define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure its values are unique.
#### 17. Create a view that displays the Patient_ids, ages, and BMI of patients.
#### 18. Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
#### 19. Explain how you can optimize the performance of SQL queries on this dataset.
